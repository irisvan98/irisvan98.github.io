        <p>Twitch is an American video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_streaming">live streaming</a> service
            operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)">Amazon</a>.[2]
            Introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv">Justin.tv</a>, the site primarily
            focuses on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video game</a> <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_live_streaming">live streaming</a>, including broadcasts
            of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports">esports</a> competitions, in addition to music
            broadcasts, creative content, and more recently, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">in real
                life"</a> streams. Content on the site can be viewed
            either live or via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand">video on demand</a>.</p>
        <p>The popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of its general-interest counterpart. In October 2013, the website had
            45
            million unique viewers,[3]:38 and by February 2014, it was considered the fourth largest source of peak
            Internet
            traffic in the United States. At the same time, Justin.tv's parent company was re-branded as Twitch
            Interactive
            to represent the shift in focus – Justin.tv was shut down in August 2014. That month, the service was
            acquired
            by Amazon for US$970 million,[4][5] which later led to the introduction of synergies with the company's
            subscription service Amazon Prime. Twitch later acquired Curse, an operator of online video gaming
            communities
            and introduced means to purchase games through links on streams along with a program allowing streamers to
            receive commissions on the sales of games that they play.</p>
        <p>By 2015, Twitch had more than 1.5 million broadcasters and 100 million viewers per month.[6] As of 2017,
            Twitch
            remained the leading live streaming video service for video games in the US, and had an advantage over
            YouTube
            Gaming.[7][8] As of May 2018, it had 2.2 million broadcasters monthly and 15 million daily active users,
            with
            around a million average concurrent users.[9][10] As of May 2018, Twitch had over 27,000 partner
            channels.[9][11]</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Founding and Inital Growth (2007-2013)</h3>
        <p>When Justin.tv was launched in 2007 by Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, the site was divided into several
            content
            categories. The gaming category grew especially fast, and became the most popular content on the
            site.[12]
            In
            June 2011,[3]:40 the company decided to spin off the gaming content as TwitchTV, inspired by the term
            twitch
            gameplay. It launched officially in public beta on June 6, 2011.[13] Since then, Twitch has attracted
            more
            than
            35 million unique visitors a month.[14][15] Twitch had about 80 employees in June 2013,[16] which
            increased
            to
            100 by December 2013.[3] The company was headquartered in San Francisco's Financial District.[3]</p>
        <p>Twitch has been supported by significant investments of venture capital, with US$15 million in 2012 (on
            top
            of
            US$7 million originally raised for Justin.tv),[17][18] and US$20 million in 2013.[19] Investors during
            three
            rounds of fund raising leading up to the end of 2013 included Draper Associates, Bessemer Venture
            Partners
            and
            Thrive Capital.[3]:40 In addition to the influx of venture funding, it was believed in 2013 that the
            company
            had
            become profitable.[3]:40</p>
        <p>Especially since the shutdown of its direct competitor Own3d.tv in early 2013, Twitch has become the most
            popular
            e-sports streaming service by a large margin, leading some to conclude that the website has a "near
            monopoly
            on
            the market".[20] Competing video services, such as YouTube and Dailymotion, began to increase the
            prominence
            of
            their gaming content to compete, but have had a much smaller impact so far.[21][22] As of mid-2013,
            there
            were
            over 43 million viewers on Twitch monthly, with the average viewer watching an hour and a half a
            day.[23] As
            of
            February 2014, Twitch is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic during peak times in the United
            States,
            behind Netflix, Google, and Apple. Twitch makes up 1.8% of total US Internet traffic during peak
            periods.[24]
        </p>
        <p>In late 2013, particularly due to increasing viewership, Twitch had issues with lag and low frame rates
            in
            Europe.[25] Twitch has subsequently added new servers in the region.[26] Also in order to address these
            problems, Twitch implemented a new video system shown to be more efficient than the previous system.
            Initially,
            the new video system was criticised by users because it caused a significant stream delay, interfering
            with
            broadcaster-viewer interaction.[27] Twitch staff said that the increased delay was likely temporary and
            at
            the
            time, was an acceptable tradeoff for the decrease in buffering.[28]</p>
        <h3>Growth, YouTube Acquisition Speculation (2014)</h3>
        <p>On February 10, 2014, Twitch's parent company (Justin.tv, Inc.) was renamed Twitch Interactive,
            reflecting
            the
            increased prominence of the service over Justin.tv as the company's main business.[29] That same month,
            a
            stream
            known as Twitch Plays Pokémon, a crowdsourced attempt to play Pokémon Red using a system translating
            chat
            commands into game controls, went viral. By February 17, the channel reached over 6.5 million total
            views
            and
            averaged concurrent viewership between 60 and 70 thousand viewers with at least 10% participating. Vice
            President of Marketing Matthew DiPietro praised the stream as "one more example of how video games have
            become a
            platform for entertainment and creativity that extends WAY beyond the original intent of the game
            creator.
            By
            merging a video game, live video and a participatory experience, the broadcaster has created an
            entertainment
            hybrid custom made for the Twitch community. This is a wonderful proof of concept that we hope to see
            more
            of in
            the future."[30][31] Beginning with its 2014 edition, Twitch was made the official live streaming
            platform
            of
            the Electronic Entertainment Expo.[32]</p>
        <p>On May 18, 2014, Variety first reported that Google had reached a preliminary deal to acquire Twitch
            through
            its
            YouTube subsidiary for approximately US$1 billion.[33][34][35][36][37]</p>
        <p>On August 5, 2014, the original Justin.tv site suddenly ceased operations, citing a need to focus
            resources
            entirely on Twitch.[38][39][40] On August 6, 2014, Twitch introduced an updated archive system, with
            multi-platform access to highlights from past broadcasts by a channel, higher quality video, increased
            server
            backups, and a new Video Manager interface for managing past broadcasts and compiling "highlights" from
            broadcasts that can also be exported to YouTube. Due to technological limitations and resource
            requirements,
            the
            new system contained several regressions; the option to archive complete broadcasts on an indefinite
            basis
            ("save forever") was removed, meaning that they can only be retained for a maximum of 14 days, or 60 for
            partners and Turbo subscribers. While compiled highlights can be archived indefinitely, they were
            limited to
            two
            hours in length.[41][42] In addition, Twitch introduced a copyright fingerprinting system that would
            mute
            audio
            in archived clips if it detected a copyrighted song in the stream.</p>
        <h3>Amazon Subsidiary (2014-present)</h3> <img
            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Twitch_booth_%2842607003590%29.jpg/220px-Twitch_booth_%2842607003590%29.jpg"
            alt="twitch booth at PAX West">
        <p>On August 25, 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch Interactive for US$970 million.[4][5] Sources reported that
            the
            rumoured Google deal had fallen through and allowed Amazon to make the bid, with Forbes reporting that
            Google
            had backed out of the deal due to potential antitrust concerns surrounding it and its existing ownership
            of
            YouTube.[43] The acquisition closed on September 25, 2014.[44] Take-Two Interactive, which owned a 2%
            stake
            at
            the time of the acquisition, made a windfall of $22 million.[45]</p>
        <p>Under Amazon, Shear continued as chief executive officer of Twitch Interactive, with Sara Clemens added
            to
            the
            executive team as chief operating officer in January 2018.[46] Shear touted the Amazon Web Services
            platform
            as
            an "attractive" aspect of the deal, and that Amazon had "built relationships with the big players in
            media",
            which could be used to the service's advantage—particularly in the realm of content licensing. The
            purchase
            of
            Twitch marked the third recent video gaming–oriented acquisition by Amazon, which had previously
            acquired
            the
            developers Reflexive Entertainment and Double Helix Games.[47]</p>
        <p>On December 9, 2014, Twitch announced it had acquired GoodGame Agency, an organisation that owns the
            esports
            teams Evil Geniuses and Alliance.[48][49] In March 2015, Twitch reset all user passwords and disabled
            all
            connections to external Twitter and YouTube accounts after the service reported that someone had gained
            "unauthorised access" to the user information of some Twitch users.[50]</p>
        <p>In June 2016, Twitch added a new feature known as "Cheering", a special form of emoticon purchased as a
            microtransaction using an in-site currency known as "Bits". Bits are bought using Amazon Payments, and
            cheers
            act as donations to the channel. Users also earn badges within a channel based on how much they have
            cheered.[51]</p>
        <p>On August 16, 2016, Twitch acquired Curse, Inc., an operator of online video gaming communities and
            gaming-oriented VoIP software.[52] In December 2016, GoodGame Agency was divested by Amazon to their
            respective
            members due to conflict of interest concerns.[53] On September 30, 2016, Twitch announced Twitch Prime,
            a
            service which provides premium features that are exclusive to users who have an active Amazon Prime
            subscription. This included advertising-free streaming, monthly offers of free add-on content ("Game
            Loot"),
            and
            game discounts.[54] Games included with the game loot rewards were Apex Legends, Legends of Runeterra,
            FIFA
            Ultimate Team, Teamfight Tactics, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, Doom Eternal, and more.[55]</p>
        <p>In December 2016, Twitch announced a semi-automated chat moderation tool (AutoMod), which uses natural
            language
            processing and machine learning to set aside potentially unwanted content for human review.[56] In
            February
            2017, Twitch announced the Twitch Game Store, a digital distribution platform that would expose digital
            purchases of games within the site's browsing interface. When streaming games available on the store,
            partnered
            channels could display a referral link to purchase the game—receiving a 5% commission. Users also
            received a
            "Twitch Crate" on every purchase, which included Bits and a collection of random chat
            emotes.[57][58][59]
        </p>
        <p>Twitch and Blizzard Entertainment signed a two-year deal in June 2017 to make Twitch be the exclusive
            streaming
            broadcaster of select Blizzard esports championship events, with viewers under Twitch Prime earning
            special
            rewards in various Blizzard games.[60] Twitch also reached a deal in 2018 to be the streaming partner of
            the
            Overwatch League, with the site also offering an "All-Access Pass" with exclusive content, emotes, and
            in-game
            items for Overwatch.[61][62]</p>
        <p>In August 2017, Twitch announced it had acquired video indexing platform ClipMine.[63]</p>
        <p>On August 20, 2018, Twitch announced that it will no longer offer advertising-free access to the entire
            service
            to Amazon Prime subscribers, with this privilege requiring the separate "Twitch Turbo" subscription or
            an
            individual channel subscription. This privilege ended for new customers effective September 14, 2018,
            and
            for
            existing customers October 2018.[64]</p>
        <p>In October 2018, Twitch announced Amazon Blacksmith, a new extension allowing broadcasters to configure
            displays
            of products associated with their streams with Amazon affiliate links.[65] On November 27, 2018, Twitch
            discontinued the Game Store service, citing that it did not generate as much additional revenue for
            partners
            as
            they hoped, and new revenue opportunities such as Amazon Blacksmith. Users retain access to their
            purchased
            games.[66]</p>
        <p>Twitch acquired the Internet Games Database (IGDB), a user-driven website similar in functionality to
            Internet
            Movie Database (IMDb) to catalog details of video games in September 2019. Twitch plans to use the
            database
            service to improve its own internal search features and help users find games they are interested
            in.[67]
        </p>
        <p>On September 26, 2019, Twitch unveiled a new logo and updated site design. The design is accompanied by a
            new
            advertising campaign, "You're already one of us", which will seek to promote the platform's community
            members.[68]</p>
        <p>Twitch began signing exclusivity deals with high-profile streamers in December 2019, starting with
            DrLupo,
            TimTheTatman, and Lirik, who had a combined 10.36 million followers at the time.[69] Dr DisRespect
            signed a
            multi-year deal in March 2020.[70]</p>
        <p>Twitch introduced a Safety Advisory Council in May 2020, made up from streamers, academics, and
            activities,
            with
            a goal to develop guidelines for moderation, work-life balance, and safeguarding the interests of
            marginalized
            communities for the platform.[71]</p>
        <p>In August of 2020, Amazon announced Twitch Prime is being rebranded as Prime Gaming. [72]</p>
        <h2>Content and Audience</h2>
        <hr>
        <img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/iMBmodUiKwSMrEinsL/giphy.gif" alt="twitchfollow">
        <p>Twitch is designed to be a platform for content, including esports tournaments, personal streams of
            individual
            players, and gaming-related talk shows.[73] A number of channels do live speedrunning.[74] The Twitch
            homepage
            currently displays games based on viewership. The typical viewer is male and aged between 18 and 34
            years of
            age, although the site has also made attempts at pursuing other demographics, including women.[23][75]
            As of
            June 2018 some of the most popular games streamed on Twitch are Fortnite, League of Legends, Dota 2,
            PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Hearthstone, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with a
            combined
            total
            of over 356 million hours watched.[76] Streamer Ninja had been among Twitch's top personalities, with
            over
            14
            million followers. In August 2019, however, Ninja announced that he would move exclusively to a
            Microsoft-owned
            competitor, Mixer.[77][78][79]</p>
        <p>Twitch has also made expansions into non-gaming content; such as in July 2013, the site streamed a
            performance of
            'Fester's Feast' from San Diego Comic-Con, and on July 30, 2014, electronic dance music act Steve Aoki
            broadcast
            a live performance from a nightclub in Ibiza.[80][81][82][83] In January 2015, Twitch introduced an
            official
            category for music streams, such as radio shows and music production activities, and in March 2015,
            announced
            that it would become the new official live streaming partner of the Ultra Music Festival, an electronic
            music
            festival in Miami.[84][85]</p>
        <p>On October 28, 2015, Twitch launched a second non-gaming category, "Creative", which is intended for
            streams
            showcasing the creation of artistic and creative works. To promote the launch, the service also streamed
            an
            eight-day marathon of Bob Ross' The Joy of Painting.[86] In July 2016, Twitch launched "Social eating"
            as a
            beta; it was inspired by the Korean phenomenon of Muk-bang and Korean players having engaged in the
            practice
            as
            intermissions on their gaming streams.[87]</p>
        <p>In March 2017, Twitch added an "IRL" category, which is designed for content within Twitch guidelines
            that
            does
            not fall within any of the other established categories on the site (such as lifelogs).[88]</p>
        <p>In May 2017, Twitch did a livestream marathon of all the episodes of the PBS Kids show, Mister Rogers'
            Neighborhood. They repeated the marathon on March 20 of the following year to honor what would have been
            Fred
            Rogers' 90th birthday.[89]</p>
        <h3>Charity</h3>
        <p>Broadcasters on Twitch often host streams promoting and raising money towards charity. By 2013, the
            website
            has
            hosted events which, in total, raised over US$8 million in donations for charitable causes, such as
            Extra
            Life
            2013.[91] As of 2017 the website has raised over US$75 million in donations for charitable causes.[92]
        </p>
        <h3>Professional Sports</h3>
        <p>In December 2017, the National Basketball Association announced that it would stream NBA G League games
            on
            Twitch
            starting on December 15; the broadcasts also include interactive statistics overlays, as well as
            additional
            streams of the games with commentary by Twitch personalities.[93] In April 2018, it was announced that
            Twitch
            would carry eleven National Football League Thursday Night Football games, as part of the league's
            renewed
            streaming deal with Amazon Prime Video. During the 2017 season, these streams were exclusive to Amazon
            Prime
            subscribers.[94]</p>
        <p>In January 2019, professional wrestling promotion Impact Wrestling announced that it would stream its
            weekly
            show
            Impact! on Twitch, in simulcast with the television airing on the U.S. cable network Pursuit Channel
            (co-owned
            with the promotion's parent company Anthem Sports & Entertainment).[95]</p>
        <p>On September 5, 2019, the National Women's Hockey League announced a three-year broadcast rights deal
            with
            Twitch, covering all games and league events. The deal also contained an agreement with the NWHL
            Players'
            Association for revenue sharing with players, and marked the first time that the NWHL had ever received
            a
            rights
            fee.[96] The National Women's Soccer League announced a three-year deal in March 2020 for Twitch to
            stream
            24
            matches per-season in the United States and Canada, collaborate on original content, and serve as the
            rightsholder for all matches outside of the United States and Canada.[97][98]</p>
        <p>On June 20, 2020, as an extension of Amazon Prime's local rights to the league, a plan to air all of the
            remaining matches of the 2019–20 season (for the resumption of play due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and a
            plan
            for some of these matches to be carried free-to-air, it was announced that Twitch would stream a package
            of
            four
            Premier League soccer matches within the United Kingdom.[99][100]</p>
        <p>On July 16, 2020, U.S. radio broadcaster Entercom announced a partnership to stream video simulcasts of
            programs
            from some of their major-market sports talk stations.[101] On July 22, 2020, Twitch officially launched
            a
            Sports
            category, primarily playing host to content streamed by sports leagues and teams on the platform.[102]
        </p>
        <h3>Emotes</h3>
        <p>Twitch features a large number of emoticons called "emotes". There are emotes free for all users, emotes
            for
            Turbo users, emotes for Twitch Prime users, and emotes for users who are subscribed to Twitch partners
            or
            affiliates.[103] As of October 2015, Kappa was the most used emote on Twitch.[104][105] Twitch partnered
            broadcasters unlock more "emote slots" as they gain more subscribers up to a maximum of 50 emotes per
            channel.[106]</p>
        <h2>Content Moderation and Restrictions</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Copyrighted Content</h3>
        <p>On August 6, 2014, Twitch announced that all on-demand videos on Twitch became subject to acoustic
            fingerprinting
            using software provided by content protection company Audible Magic; if copyrighted music (particularly,
            songs
            played by users from outside of the game they are playing) is detected, the 30-minute portion of the
            video
            which
            contains the music will be muted. Live broadcasts were not subject to these filters.[107][108] A system
            was
            available for those who believed they were inappropriately affected and had rights to the music they
            used to
            challenge the filtering.[109] Twitch offered selection of royalty-free music library for streamers to
            use,
            which
            is expanded upon later in January 2015.[84] The audio filtering system, along with the lack of
            communication
            surrounding the changes in general, proved to be controversial among users. In a Reddit AMA, co-founder
            Emmett
            Shear admitted that his staff had "screwed up" and should have provided advance warning of the changes,
            and
            promised that Twitch had "absolutely no intention" of implementing audio filtering on live
            broadcasts.[110]
        </p>
        <p>In June 2020, Twitch received a large wave of DMCA takedown notices aimed at year-old VODs and "clips"
            (short
            segments of VODs separated out by viewers) that contain copyrighted music from 2017-19. Twitch complied
            with
            the
            takedowns and also issued a number of copyright strikes against viewers. Concerned streamers were
            notified
            that
            they should remove all VODs and clips if not certain they did not contain copyrighted material. This
            provoked
            major backlash, both at the loss of prior content but also based on viability concerns due to an
            inability
            to
            review or even rapidly delete content. There were also complaints based that strikes were being issued
            on
            viewer-created clips, even where the streamer-created content was deleted.[111][112][113]

        </p>
        <h3>Mature Content</h3>
        <p>Mature content
            Twitch users are not allowed to stream any game that is rated "Adults Only" (AO) in the United States by
            the
            Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), regardless of its rating in any other geographical region,
            and
            any
            game that contains "overtly sexual content" or "gratuitous violence", or content which violates the
            terms of
            use
            of third-party services.[114][115]</p>
        <p>Twitch has also explicitly banned specific games from streaming, regardless of rating; this includes
            games
            such
            as BMX XXX, eroge visual novel games (such as Dramatical Murder), HuniePop, Rinse and Repeat, Second
            Life,
            and
            Yandere Simulator.[115][116][117][118] The banning of Yandere Simulator was criticized by YandereDev,
            the
            developer of the game. He believed that the game was being arbitrarily singled out with no explanation,
            as
            Twitch has not banned other games with similarly excessive sexual or violent content such as Mortal
            Kombat
            X,
            Grand Theft Auto, or The Witcher 3.[117][119]</p>
        <p>Twitch took temporary action in May 2019 after channels related to the video game Artifact began to be
            used
            for
            inappropriate content. Artifact, a major game by Valve, had lost most of its audience in just months
            from
            its
            release, and by late May 2019, several popular livestreamers commented that the total viewership for
            Artifact
            streams had dropped to near zero. In the days that followed, several streams started to make streams
            purporting
            to be Artifact gameplay but was trolling or other off-topic content. Initially these new streams were
            playing
            with the viewers or were jokes, such as showing animal videos or League of Legends matches. After a few
            days,
            other Artifact channel streams appeared containing content that was against the terms of Twitch's use
            policy,
            including full copyrighted movies, pornography, Nazi propaganda, and at least one stream that showed the
            entirety of the shooter's video from the Christchurch mosque shootings. The titles of such streams were
            usually
            presented to imply they were showing other content while waiting in queue for Artifact matches as to
            appear
            legitimate. As word of these streams in the Artifact section grew, Twitch took action, deleting the
            account
            that
            streamed the Christchurch shooting.[120] Twitch then took steps to temporarily ban new accounts from
            streaming
            until they can resolve the issue.[121] By June 2019, Twitch started taking legal actions against one
            hundred
            "John Doe" streamers in a California court, accusing them of trademark infringement, breach of contract,
            fraud,
            and unlawful use of the service that was harming and scaring away users of the service.[122][123]</p>
        <h3>Hate Speech and Harrassment</h3>
        <p>In February 2018, Twitch updated its acceptable content policies to deem that any channel directing hate
            speech
            or harassment to be suspended from its platform.[124]</p>
        <p>Also in June 2020, a number of women stepped forward with accusations towards several streamers on Twitch
            and
            other services related to sexual misconduct and harassment claims.[125] Twitch stated it would review
            all
            reported incidents and comply with law enforcement in any investigative efforts. However, several
            popular
            streamers on Twitch's service believed that the platform could do more to evaluate the accused
            individuals,
            prevent incidents, and protect others in the future, and used June 24, 2020 as a Twitch blackout day,
            not
            streaming any content through Twitch to show their support.[126] By the evening of June 24, 2020, Twitch
            had
            placed several bans on the accounts of those accused after completing their investigation, and stated in
            a
            blog
            post they would be forwarding additional details to law enforcement.[127]

        </p>
        <p>Twitch temporarily suspended an account belonging to President Donald Trump's campaign on June 29, 2020
            after
            the
            channel used it to stream some of Trump's prior campaign speeches, which included a 2016 campaign rally
            in
            which
            he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. Twitch stated that "hateful conduct is not allowed" as reason
            for
            the
            suspension.[128]

        </p>
        <h2>Internet Censorship</h2>
        <hr>
        <i>Main article: Internet censorship in China</i>
        <p>As of September 20, 2018, the Twitch website is blocked and the app is blocked from the Apple App Store
            in
            China.[129]</p>
        <h2>Partner and Affiliate Programs</h2>
        <hr>
        <img src="twitchpartner 600.jpg" alt="twitch partner/affiliate">
        <p>In July 2011, Twitch launched its Partner Program,[130] which reached over 11,000 members by August
            2015.[131]
        </p>
        <p>Similar to the Partner Program of other video sites like YouTube, the Partner Program allows popular
            content
            producers to share in the advertisement revenue generated from their streams. Additionally, Twitch users
            can
            subscribe to partnered streamers' channels for US$4.99 a month, often granting the user access to unique
            emoticons, live chat privileges, and other various perks. Twitch retains US$2.49 of every US$4.99
            channel
            subscription, with the remaining US$2.50 going directly to the partnered streamer.[132] Although
            exceptions
            were
            made, Twitch previously required that prospective partners have an "average concurrent viewership of
            500+",
            as
            well as a consistent streaming schedule of at least three days a week.[133] However, since the launch of
            the
            'Achievements' feature, there is a clearer "Path to Partnership" with trackable goals for concurrent
            viewership,
            duration and frequency of streams.[134][135]</p>
        <p>In April 2017, Twitch launched its "Affiliate Program" that allows smaller channels to generate revenue
            as
            well,
            also announcing that it would allow channels access to multi-priced subscription tiers.[136][137] The
            participants of this program get some but not all of the benefits of the Twitch Partners. Streamers can
            make
            profit from cheering with Bits which are purchasable from Twitch directly.[138] Affiliates are also able
            to
            access the Twitch Subscriptions feature, with all the same functionality that Partners have access to,
            with
            a
            maximum of five subscriber emotes.[139] In September 2019, the service announced that Affiliates would
            now
            receive a share of ad revenue.[140]

        </p>
        <p>Advertising on the site has been handled by a number of partners. In 2011, Twitch had an exclusive deal
            with
            Future US.[141] On April 17, 2012, Twitch announced a deal to give CBS Interactive the rights to
            exclusively
            sell advertising, promotions and sponsorships for the community.[75][142] On June 5, 2013, Twitch
            announced
            the
            formation of the Twitch Media Group, a new in-house advertisement sales team which has taken over CBS
            Interactive's role of selling advertisements.[15]
